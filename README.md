## Usage

### S3 Integration

EventPics uses the [`django-storages`](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to store photos in an S3 bucket. For EventPics to function you **must** set the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME=
AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=
```

The [`django-storages`](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/s3_compatible/index.html) documentation provides instructions for configuration with S3 compatible object storage services.

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dbrennand/EventPics && cd EventPics/docker
    ```

2. Create the `.env` file from the example:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. Populate the `.env` file with your environment variables:

    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

4. Deploy the application using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

By default the application will be available over HTTPS at [`localhost`](https://localhost). The default configuration is for development purposes and should not be used in production. The provided [`docker-compose.yml`](docker/docker-compose.yml) file uses [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a reverse proxy. For production deployments, modify the [`Caddyfile`](docker/conf/Caddyfile) to issue certificates using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) via the [HTTP-01](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#http-challenge) challenge. Below is a minimal example:

```
{
    email hello@example.com
}

eventpics.example.com {
    reverse_proxy eventpics:8000
}
```
